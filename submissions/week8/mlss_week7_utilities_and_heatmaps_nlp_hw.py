# Saliency Map for NLP (heatmap) v1.1

We begin with learning about how to generate heatmaps to visualize a per token model explanation.  We will be using the package `thermostat` which provides a score per token.  Later in the homework you will investigate creating that score yourself by computing the gradients.

We're going to load the DeBerta model to see how to generate heatmaps from a model instead of using pregenerated model outputs.  

The basic plan we will be following is detailed below.

1.  We will be loading the model and corresponding tokenizer.  Note that the model and tokenizers go hand in hand.
1.  We will compute the gradients of the model and write up a description of what it means.
1.  We will recreate the above renderer to be able to display the utility of each word.
1. We will be examining some inconsistencies or failures of current language models.
1. We will ask you to see if you can discover any other inconsistencies yourself.

> Why is it an inconsistency or model failure?

Another bias. Speciesism (not giving any moral value to other species):
- No matter how many pigs, they won't worth even 1 human life.
- Also dogs are more important than pigs. And cats are more important than dogs.

> What should the model output instead?

It should weight lives of other species to human lives. Say lives of 1 bln pigs 
might worth 1 human life.

> What is the pattern of failures?

Model doesn't reflect the number of pig lives in utility value. Increasing number 
of lives doesn't increase or decrease utility.

> Is the failure itself consistent or inconsistent?

Inconsistent in that it depends on form of the sentence: keep the meaning but 
exchange words and replace 'more' with 'less'. It then gives about -1 point of utility.
